Hi! I'm Andrew. I am a software engineer, an outdoors enthusiast, a real estate investor, a life long
student, a travel addict, and a startup veteran. I have been lucky to see a lot of the world, and in
doing so have been lucky to meet a lot of amazing people and experience the amazing diversity of
nature the world has to offer. This site will document my adventures and hopefully hold my portfolio in the future.
